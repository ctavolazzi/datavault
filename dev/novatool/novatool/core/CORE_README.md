# NovaTool Core Architecture

## Overview
The core architecture of NovaTool is built around a central "Hub and Controller" pattern, designed to provide a clean, maintainable, and scalable way to manage AI operations.

## Key Components

### 1. AI Hub (ðŸŒŸ Central Component)
The AIHub serves as the central nervous system of our AI operations:
- Manages state and resources
- Handles all AI model interactions
- Provides real-time monitoring
- Coordinates between different components
- Maintains system health metrics

```python
AIHub
â”œâ”€â”€ State Management
â”œâ”€â”€ Resource Monitoring
â”œâ”€â”€ Model Interactions
â”œâ”€â”€ Health Metrics
â””â”€â”€ Operation Coordination
```

### 2. Controllers
Controllers provide clean interfaces to interact with the hub:
- Handle business logic
- Manage user interactions
- Route commands appropriately
- Handle errors gracefully

```python
Controllers
â”œâ”€â”€ AIController
â”œâ”€â”€ ModelController
â””â”€â”€ DataController
```

### 3. UI Components
Rich, interactive components for user feedback:
- Progress bars
- Status indicators
- Health monitors
- Resource usage displays
- Error messages

## Design Principles

1. **Single Source of Truth**
   - AIHub maintains the central state
   - All operations go through the hub
   - Consistent state management

2. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Hub handles core operations
   - Controllers manage business logic
   - UI components handle display
   - Clear boundaries between components

3. **Real-Time Feedback**
   - Live status updates
   - Progress tracking
   - Health monitoring
   - Resource usage display

4. **Error Handling**
   - Centralized error management
   - Graceful degradation
   - Clear user feedback
   - Recovery mechanisms

## Usage Example

```python
async def main():
    # Initialize the system
    hub = AIHub()
    controller = AIController(hub)

    # Start monitoring
    await controller.start()

    # Process queries
    with Live(hub.display_status()):
        response = await controller.process_query(
            "What is quantum computing?"
        )

        # Display results
        print(response)
```

## Benefits

1. **Maintainability**
   - Clear structure
   - Easy to extend
   - Well-defined interfaces
   - Modular design

2. **Scalability**
   - Easy to add new features
   - Supports multiple models
   - Handles concurrent operations
   - Resource-aware

3. **User Experience**
   - Real-time feedback
   - Beautiful UI
   - Clear error messages
   - Progress tracking

4. **Developer Experience**
   - Clean API
   - Easy to test
   - Well-documented
   - Consistent patterns

## Future Enhancements

1. **Planned Features**
   - WebSocket support
   - Database integration
   - Advanced scheduling
   - Plugin system

2. **Optimizations**
   - Caching layer
   - Resource pooling
   - Load balancing
   - Performance monitoring

## Getting Started

1. Initialize the hub:
   ```python
   hub = AIHub()
   ```

2. Create a controller:
   ```python
   controller = AIController(hub)
   ```

3. Start the system:
   ```python
   await controller.start()
   ```

4. Process queries:
   ```python
   response = await controller.process_query("Your query here")
   ```

## Best Practices

1. Always use the controller interface
2. Monitor hub status regularly
3. Handle errors appropriately
4. Keep the UI responsive
5. Follow async patterns

## Contributing

When adding new features:
1. Follow the existing pattern
2. Update documentation
3. Add appropriate tests
4. Maintain UI consistency
