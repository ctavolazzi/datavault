2. **Religious Views**: Various religions provide their own answers. For instance, in Christianity, the purpose of life could be seen as serving God and loving others. In Buddhism, it may involve overcoming suffering and achieving enlightenment.

3. **Personal Fulfillment**: Many people find meaning in personal relationships, achievements, creativity, or pursuing passions. This subjective approach emphasizes individual experiences and values.
